# Awesome Domain Modeling

Domain Modeling is a technic aiming to resolve a business problem through the design of a set of small, well-shaped, models, collaborating with each others, based on the discovery and understanding of a (sub-)domain.

It is closely related to Domain-Driven Design and is part of the Tactical side of this approach.

It is NOT related to any language, framework or paradigm.

Other modeling technics includes "data-driven modeling" (focusing on database table structure), "class-driven modeling" (for UML based projects) or even [God Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object).
