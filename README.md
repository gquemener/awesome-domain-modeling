# Awesome Domain Modeling

## Introduction

Modeling is the act of building a simplification of a reality in order to solve a problem. Too simple and it will not solve the problem, too complex and it will become the new problem. A day-to-day example is a map. Tons of different kinds of maps exist (world map, city map, bicycle map, maritime map, subway map), and each is aiming to solve a very specific problem. A single map containing all those informations would most likely be unreadable and require an extensive amount of effort to use !

Domain Modeling is a technic aiming to resolve a business problem through the design of a set of small, well-shaped, models, collaborating with each others, based on the discovery and understanding of a (sub-)domain.

It is closely related to Domain-Driven Design and is part of the Tactical side of this approach.

It is NOT related to any language, framework or paradigm.

Other modeling technics includes "data-driven modeling" (focusing on database table structure), "class-driven modeling" (for UML based projects) or even [God Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object).
